# 0.6.0 (March 14, 2022)

NOTES:

* The `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec` dependency has been updated to match `terraform-plugin-sdk`, which replaced the removed `tfinstall` package with `github.com/hashicorp/hc-install`. This will resolve Go build errors for projects that import both `terraform-plugin-docs` and `terraform-plugin-sdk`.
